This document aims to explain in one or two sentences the content of each lib or source code present in the gSOAP folder.
We will only focus on libs and source code that we would eventualy have in the folder of our main program.

This document is subject to update.

- dom.c and dom.cpp  
(DOM = Document Object Model)
Occasionally we will need to work with raw XML data. Raw XML can be parsed with a DOM parser and stored in a DOM node graph. 
The DOM (Document Object Model) node graph (actually a node tree) can be inspected to retrieve text and other values. 
We can iteratively and recursively traverse the XML tree via its DOM node graph at increasingly deeper levels to inspect and retrieve values of XML elements and attributes.

- stdsoap2.cpp .c or.h
Main code of the executable soapcpp2.

- mecevp.c (should be rename .cpp in a C++ application) 
Code for encryption and decryption of messages using the EVP interface of OpenSSL 

- smdevp.c (should be rename .cpp in a C++ application)
Computes signed/unsigned message digests over any type of data using the EVP interface of OpenSSL.

- thread.c (should be rename .cpp in a C++ application)
code for portable threads and locks API implementation

- wsaapi.c (should be rename .cpp in a C++ application)
WS-Addressing plugin.

- wsseapi.cpp 
WS-Security plugin

****************************************
Generated code with wsdl2h and soapcpp2
****************************************

- onvif.h
Header file created from wsdl2h using ONVIF APIs. Contains definitions of namespaces, classes, functions from APIs


Depending on what API you called to create onvif.h you may not have all the following source code generated from soapcpp2

- soapAdvancedSecurityServiceBindingProxy.cpp


- soapC.cpp
Code for Client side contain functions used for the client.

- soapDeviceBindingProxy.cpp
Contains functions to know more about the service pointed.

- soapDeviceIOBindingProxy.cpp
Contains functions to controle I/O about the service pointed.

- soapH.h
Header file of SoapC.cpp


- soapImagingBindingProxy.cpp
All about getting images, setting up etc...


- soapMediaBindingProxy.cpp
Streaming lib

- soapPTZBindingProxy.cpp
Code for PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom)

- soapPullPointSubscriptionBindingProxy.cpp
I am not sure but it may be about messaging 

- soapRemoteDiscoveryBindingProxy.cpp
WS-Discovery

- soapStub.h
Definitions of classes and functions

- soapwsddProxy.cpp
Also WS-Discovery (???)
